# Object-detection-with-openCV
Code backup for project involving openCV and Python

Goal of the project is training the YOLO v4 model so it can recognize friendly and enemy soldiers in shooter video game.
Project is practice for larger self-driving robot project.

Model was trained 5.5h using Google Collab resources, openCV detection program is runing in real time in 10-20 frames per second.
In current state, Python based detection program can take 20 screenshots per second of live window (desktop), process the data seen on the screenshots, decide what he is able to detect and replicate that in separate window.

Data set for training was very little, 350 screenshots of the chosen game.

For something done in so little time, he is fairly accurate, better training data set would produce better results.

Included with the code backup is video sample, video sample has higher error rate due to game screen being lower resolution.

Based on multiple sources including Youtube, StackOverflow, Github, etc
